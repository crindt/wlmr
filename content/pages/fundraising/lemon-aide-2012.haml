  Our community has come together once again to help our family with
  all the expenses of raising two children with extraordinary medical
  needs.  It's a very simple concept.  Our community and friends are
  hosting Lemon-aid for Tanner around North County and donating the
  proceeds to our family.

  Check the Weelittlemanrico [Facebook
  page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Weelittlemanrico/462839513730559)
  for additional updates.  We will also update locations as we get
  them on the fundraiser page here at Tanner's website.

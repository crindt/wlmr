          :markdown 

            Tanner is much like your typical six year-old boy.  He loves hanging
            out with his friends, playing super heroes, and of course teasing
            his big sister, Pria.  The thing that is different about Tanner is
            that he has trouble running and jumping.  He can not kick a ball,
            and he often falls for what seems to be for no reason at all.

            Tanner was born with [Duchenne Muscular Dystrophies][DMD] (DMD).

            Around the same time Tanner was diagnosed with DMD, our daughter
            Pria's sweet little pixie girl voice began to change.  At first we
            thought she just had a cold, but after a couple of weeks with her
            voice sounding more and more like a young Demi Moore, off to the
            specialist we went.  After a scope down her throat and a month of
            medication and exploratory surgery she was diagnosed [Recurrent
            Respiratory Papillomatosis][RPP], or RRP.

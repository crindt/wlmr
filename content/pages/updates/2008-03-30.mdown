# March 2008

We are working on putting a team together for our annual MDA Stride and Ride 5K
on March 2, Tanner's Trotter.  This should be a great time.  If you'd like to
join us send us an email and we would love to have you be apart of out team.

Thank you for your continued prayer we need them more than ever right now.  God
bless you and much love to you all.
